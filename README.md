Inside this main directory, the first file to open is the FinalReport.docx containing our 8 pages report containing the overall information. 

Inside PartACode, we can find our unit tests. Go inside PartACode/src/test/java to find our unit tests for todos and projects.

Inside ReportFiles, we have all the documenation (session, bug summary, scripts from POSTMAN for our session) and our summary section with the findings and concerns of our sessions). This folder also contain the videoUnitTests.mp4 that runs our unit tests.
Otherwise, it can be accessed at this YouTube link. https://youtu.be/PcwLmJWEopA
